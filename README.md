# CS113-Labs
My .cpp files for CS113 Labs SNHU.

## Lab 1
The first piece of the lab is a simple print statement that prints ``"Hello World!"``.

The second piece is simple character art, using multiple print statements and escape characters to display the art.

The final section of the lab is squaring a number taken in as input (through ``cin``). Then, my solution uses the ``pow(a, b)`` function to square the input number.
The first parameter is the base, and the second is the exponent. Finally, the program prints ``The number squared:``, followed by the previously calculated square.
